Brief Description of the Application : 
A React weather application using API and Axios is a web-based application that allows users to search for the current weather conditions of a particular location. The application uses a weather API and Axios, a JavaScript library for making HTTP requests to the server.

Here is how the application works:

1. The user enters the name of a location in the search bar of the application.
2. The application sends an HTTP request to the weather API using Axios library, passing in the user's input as a parameter.
3. The API returns the current weather conditions for the requested location in JSON format.
4. The application extracts the relevant information from the JSON response and displays it on the user's screen, including the temperature, weather description, and location name.

The application can be built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The user interface can be designed using HTML and CSS, and the application logic can be implemented using JavaScript.

To integrate the weather API into the application, you will need to obtain an API key from a weather service provider such as OpenWeatherMap or WeatherStack. You can then use this API key to make HTTP requests to the weather API and retrieve the weather data for a particular location.

Axios library can be used to make HTTP requests from within the React application. It provides a simple and easy-to-use API for making GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to the server. To use Axios in your application, you will need to install it using NPM, and then import it into your code.

Overall, a React weather application using API and Axios can be a great way to practice building web applications with React, and integrating external APIs into your application.

In this project I have used, OpenWeatherMap for API key.
